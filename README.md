# Motion Concept C\*

A concept animation library for the web. The primary design goals are:

1. Minimize bundlesize - currently **1.75kb** but I'm budgeting for around 3 (vs Anime.js @ 7 and Greensock @ 25).
2. Improve [WebAnimations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) DX
3. Subvert WAAPI's technical limitations (springs, individual transforms etc) by re-evaluating trade-offs.
