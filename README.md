# Motion R&D Division 1

A concept animation library for the web. The primary design goals are:

1. Minimize bundlesize
2. Improve [WebAnimations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) DX
3. Subvert WAAPI's technical limitations (springs, individual transforms etc) by re-evaluating trade-offs.
